### 🧠 Prompt Type
Metaphor-Driven Explanation for Older Adults (Age ~70+)

### 🛠️ Prompt Techniques Used
- **Familiar Context** — Using a card game analogy to connect with a senior audience  
- **Plain Language** — Avoiding technical jargon while keeping accuracy  
- **Stepwise Reasoning** — Breaking AI’s process into 5 logical stages  
- **Gentle Tone** — Respectful and relatable communication  
- **Technical Anchoring** — Each analogy linked to a real AI function  

### 📬 Prompt
Explain how AI receives, processes, and produces answers using the analogy of a friendly card game. Make it easy to understand for a 70+ audience who may have little to no tech experience. Use 5 short bullet points, all tied to real technical processes, in a soft and easy-going tone.

### ✉️ Response
Imagine AI as a friendly player at your card table, always ready for a new round:

1. **Shuffling the Deck (Receiving the Question)** — When you speak to me, it’s like being handed a fresh deck of cards — your words are the cards, and I see the whole deck at once.  
2. **Sorting the Cards (Understanding the Meaning)** — I arrange the cards by suit and number — just like I break your words into smaller parts and spot patterns I’ve learned before.  
3. **Choosing the Best Play (Selecting Information)** — Like picking the smartest move in the game, I choose the most fitting facts and ideas from what I know.  
4. **Laying the Cards Down (Creating the Answer)** — I place the cards in an order that makes sense — turning my chosen ideas into clear sentences.  
5. **Finishing the Round (Sending It Back to You)** — When my play is done, I pass it back to you so the game — our conversation — can keep going.  

### 🔍 Why This Works
This analogy uses a familiar and social activity to explain AI’s inner workings without overwhelming detail. By linking each step to real processes — input parsing, pattern recognition, decision selection, structured output, and feedback — it balances approachability with accuracy.
